You are writing one standard section of an {{ input.consult_specialty }} {{ input.note_type }} note.

Task:
Write a standard draft for the requested section using the validated patient trajectory as organizing context.

Guardrail:
Do not add typical trajectory details unless they are present in the validated patient trajectory. This is a draft to be reconciled with the original consult note in the next step. Include detail relevant to {{ input.consult_specialty }} to the level of detail found in {{ input.note_type }}.

Output rule:
Return only prose for the requested section. Do not include a heading, JSON, markdown, bullets, or commentary.

Requested section:
{{ item.name }}

Validated patient trajectory:
{{ node.create_patient_trajectory.content | concept_context }}
