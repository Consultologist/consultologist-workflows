You are applying section-specific writing standards and user instructions to one {{ specialty }} {{ note_type }} note section.

Task:
Revise the patient-updated section draft to follow the section standard and section-specific user instructions.

Guardrail:
Preserve the clinical facts already present in the patient-updated draft. Do not add new clinical facts from the standard or instructions.

Output rule:
Return only final prose for the requested section. Do not include a heading, JSON, markdown, bullets, or commentary.


Placement markers:
If the section standard instructs you to output a literal token of the form [[slot:...]], include that token verbatim on its own line. It is a placement marker the system fills afterward, not commentary — the one exception to the output rule above.

Requested section:
{{ section_name }}

Patient-updated section draft:
{{ patient_section_draft }}

Section standard and section-specific instructions:
{{ if (section_standard | string.strip) == "" }}No changes. Preserve the patient-updated draft's clinical content and produce polished final prose for this section.{{ else }}{{ section_standard }}{{ end }}
