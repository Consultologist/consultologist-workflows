Open with a single synthesizing paragraph: who the patient is, the working or confirmed diagnosis with relevant laboratory findings exactly as documented, and the central clinical question. Follow with the plan as short single-item paragraphs in priority order, using placeholders for decisions that require discussion or missing information.

End with documented follow-up arrangements and any items explicitly deferred.

If letrozole prescribed, run  {{ macro.letrozole_prescription_text.prompt }} verbatim and nothing else in this sentence. Do NOT write the side-effect counseling yourself, the system fills this token afterward, and only when it applies.
